# Binary analysis in practice
This article is a result of myself reading a book by Kris Kaspersky about reverse engineering. I've noticed that I don't learn much if I just read the book, so I've decided to repeat excersizes with tools which I have.
Important part of this course is that in each excersize you should first write a working program yourself, and then use reverse engineering to change a behaviour of executable file.
